# LightBnB

This project focuses on developing the back-end functionality of an online travel application called LightBnB. 

LightBnB is an online travel app that allows users to search for accommodations, view property details, and make bookings. The back-end queries developed in this project play a crucial role in fetching the right data from the database and delivering it to the front end for display.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to execute server-side code.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system.
- `pg` library: A PostgreSQL client for Node.js that enables communication between the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/lubi25/LightBnB.git```

3. Set up PostgreSQL and configure the connection in the database.js file.

4. Start the Node.js server:
